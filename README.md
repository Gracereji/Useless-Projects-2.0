### Project Description

AI Horoscope for Inanimate Objects is a playful and creative web app that generates humorous "cosmic readings" for everyday household items. Using a fun, AI-inspired style, the app allows users to choose an object‚Äîsuch as a hair dryer‚Äîand receive a whimsical horoscope prediction, complete with a lucky number, a warning about what to avoid for the day, and a cosmic caution.

The project combines engaging visuals with a cosmic theme:

Vibrant UI with animated star backgrounds.

Dynamic Predictions that make each reading unique and entertaining.

Thematic Elements like "Lucky Number" and "Avoid Today" to mimic real horoscope formats.

This app is designed purely for fun, blending a starry aesthetic with lighthearted text to give ordinary objects extraordinary destinies.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Household items everywhere are silently suffering from a deep existential crisis ‚Äî your hair dryer doesn‚Äôt know its life‚Äôs purpose, your toaster feels underappreciated, and your fridge wonders if it‚Äôs just a glorified food prison. They‚Äôve been longing for cosmic guidance, but tragically, astrology has ignored them for centuries.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]
Enter AI Horoscope for Inanimate Objects ‚Äî the cutting-edge, star-reading service that finally gives your belongings the life advice they never knew they needed. Using a blend of cosmic nonsense and AI-flavored fun, it delivers:

Personalized predictions for your everyday objects.

Daily warnings so your blender can avoid bad vibes.

Because why should humans have all the mystical fun?
